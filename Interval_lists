# Preparation of interval list file for GATK WES analysis
# Picard tools require intevral_list instead of Bed files to annotate coordinates of genomic regions.
# In this analysis are two Bed files converted to interval_lists and then combined. The aim is to combine two original interval_lists and keep only genomic regions which are present in both original interval_lists.

# Tried to run BedToIntervalList but got error message
# Received error: Sequence 'chr1' was not found in the sequence dictionary
# Removed 'chr' from chromosome_name of bed file
cat twist_exome.bed | sed 's/chr//g' > twist_exome_v2.bed

# Then received error message picard.PicardException: Sequence '7_gl000195_random' was not found in the sequence dictionary
# Removed contig from the bed file
cat twist_exome_v2.bed | sed '/7_gl000195_random/d' > twist_exome_v3.bed
